# Hey there! 👋 I'm Matthieu

Welcome to my digital playground! This is where I showcase my passion for creating beautiful, functional web experiences.

## 🚀 About This Portfolio

This isn't just another portfolio website - it's a reflection of my journey as a developer from Martelange, Belgium. After 6+ years in the tech world, I've learned that the best projects come from combining solid technical skills with genuine creativity and attention to detail.

### What Makes This Special?

- **Built with Love**: Every animation, every gradient, every interaction has been carefully crafted
- **Modern Tech Stack**: React 19, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion - I love working with cutting-edge tools
- **Personal Touch**: From the animated logo to the contact form, everything reflects my personality
- **Real Projects**: The portfolio showcases actual work I'm proud of, not just demo projects

## 🛠️ The Tech Behind the Magic

I'm a firm believer in using the right tools for the job. Here's what powers this portfolio:

### Core Technologies

- **React 19** - Because I love working with the latest and greatest
- **Tailwind CSS** - My go-to for rapid, maintainable styling
- **Framer Motion** - For those smooth animations that make users smile
- **EmailJS** - So you can actually reach me through the contact form!

### Why These Choices?

- **Performance First**: Every dependency serves a purpose
- **Developer Experience**: Tools that make me productive and happy
- **User Experience**: Technologies that create delightful interactions

## 🎨 My Design Philosophy

I believe great web experiences happen when:

- **Function meets beauty** - It should work perfectly AND look amazing
- **Performance matters** - Nobody likes waiting for slow websites
- **Details count** - Those little animations and transitions make all the difference
- **Accessibility is key** - Everyone should be able to use what I build

## 💌 The Contact Form Actually Works!

Unlike many portfolio sites, my contact form isn't just for show. It's powered by EmailJS, so when you send me a message, I actually receive it!

If you want to set up something similar:

1. Head to [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/)
2. Set up your service and template
3. Update `src/config/emailjs.js` with your credentials
4. Watch the magic happen!
